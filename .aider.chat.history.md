A stylized invoice icon with a checkmark, rendered in a clean modern style. The icon is centered on a solid blue background, with a subtle gradient from light to dark blue. The invoice outline is white, with a small green checkmark in the top right corner to indicate completion. The overall composition is balanced and professional, suitable for a business invoicing app.
